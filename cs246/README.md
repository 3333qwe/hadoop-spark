My solutions for the [CS246 Mining Massive Datasets working group](
http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/events/225025313/). The working group is part of Silicon Valley Hands On Programming Meetup. The participants meet once a week to discuss solutions of some homework problems from Stanford's 2014 Winter [CS246](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/index.html) course.
